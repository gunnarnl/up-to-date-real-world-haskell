<h1 data-number="1" id="have-we-got-a-deal-for-you"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Have we got a deal for you!</h1>
<p>Haskell is a deep language, and we think that learning it is a hugely
rewarding experience. We will focus on three elements as we explain why.
The first is <em>novelty</em>: we invite you to think about programming
from a different and valuable perspective. The second is <em>power</em>:
we'll show you how to create software that is short, fast, and safe.
Lastly, we offer you a lot of <em>fun</em>: the pleasure of applying
beautiful programming techniques to solve real problems.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="novelty"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Novelty</h2>
<p>Haskell is most likely quite different from any language you've ever
used before. Compared to the usual set of concepts in a programmer's
mental toolbox, functional programming offers us a profoundly different
way to think about software.</p>
<p>In Haskell, we de-emphasise code that modifies data. Instead, we
focus on functions that take immutable values as input and produce new
values as output. Given the same inputs, these functions always return
the same results. This is a core idea behind functional programming.</p>
<p>Along with not modifying data, our Haskell functions usually don't
talk to the external world; we call these functions <em>pure</em>. We
make a strong distinction between pure code and the parts of our
programs that read or write files, communicate over network connections,
or make robot arms move. This makes it easier to organize, reason about,
and test our programs.</p>
<p>We abandon some ideas that might seem fundamental, such as having a
<code>for</code> loop built into the language. We have other, more
flexible, ways to perform repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>Even the way in which we evaluate expressions is different in
Haskell. We defer every computation until its result is actually needed:
Haskell is a <em>lazy</em> language. Laziness is not merely a matter of
moving work around: it profoundly affects how we write programs.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="power"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Power</h2>
<p>Throughout this book, we will show you how Haskell's alternatives to
the features of traditional languages are powerful, flexible, and lead
to reliable code. Haskell is positively crammed full of cutting edge
ideas about how to create great software.</p>
<p>Since pure code has no dealings with the outside world, and the data
it works with is never modified, the kinds of nasty surprise in which
one piece of code invisibly corrupts data used by another are very rare.
Whatever context we use a pure function in, it will behave
consistently.</p>
<p>Pure code is easier to test than code that deals with the outside
world. When a function only responds to its visible inputs, we can
easily state properties of its behavior that should always be true. We
can automatically test that those properties hold for a huge body of
random inputs, and when our tests pass, we move on. We still use
traditional techniques to test code that must interact with files,
networks, or exotic hardware. Since there is much less of this impure
code than we would find in a traditional language, we gain much more
assurance that our software is solid.</p>
<p>Lazy evaluation has some spooky effects. Let's say we want to find
the <em>k</em> least-valued elements of an unsorted list. In a
traditional language, the obvious approach would be to sort the list and
take the first <em>k</em> elements, but this is expensive. For
efficiency, we would instead write a special function that takes these
values in one pass, and it would have to perform some moderately complex
book-keeping. In Haskell, the sort-then-take approach actually performs
well: laziness ensures that the list will only be sorted enough to find
the <em>k</em> minimal elements.</p>
<p>Better yet, our Haskell code that operates so efficiently is tiny,
and uses standard library functions.</p>
<div class="captioned-content">
<div class="caption">
KMinima.hs
</div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">-- lines beginning with &quot;--&quot; are comments.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>

</div>
<p>It can take a while to develop an intuitive feel for when lazy
evaluation is important, but when we exploit it, the resulting code is
often clean, brief, and efficient.</p>
<p>As the above example shows, an important aspect of Haskell's power
lies in the compactness of the code we write. Compared to working in
popular traditional languages, when we develop in Haskell we often write
much less code, in substantially less time, and with fewer bugs.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="enjoyment"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Enjoyment</h2>
<p>We believe that it is easy to pick up the basics of Haskell
programming, and that you will be able to successfully write small
programs within a matter of hours or days.</p>
<p>Since effective programming in Haskell differs greatly from other
languages, you should expect that mastering both the language itself and
functional programming techniques will require plenty of thought and
practice.</p>
<p>Harking back to our own days of getting started with Haskell, the
good news is that the fun begins early: it's simply an entertaining
challenge to dig into a new language, in which so many commonplace ideas
are different or missing, and to figure out how to write simple
programs.</p>
<p>For us, the initial pleasure lasted as our experience grew and our
understanding deepened. In other languages, it's difficult to see any
connection between science and the nuts-and-bolts of programming. In
Haskell, we have imported some ideas from abstract mathematics and put
them to work. Even better, we find that not only are these ideas easy to
pick up, they have a practical payoff in helping us to write more
compact, reusable code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we won't be putting any "brick walls" in your way: there
are no especially difficult or gruesome techniques in this book that you
must master in order to be able to program effectively.</p>
<p>That being said, Haskell is a rigorous language: it will make you
perform more of your thinking up front. It can take a little while to
adjust to debugging much of your code before you ever run it, in
response to the compiler telling you that something about your program
does not make sense. Even with years of experience, we remain astonished
and pleased by how often our Haskell programs simply work on the first
try, once we fix those compilation errors.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="what-to-expect-from-this-book"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> What to expect from this
book</h1>
<p>We started this project because a growing number of people are using
Haskell to solve everyday problems. Because Haskell has its roots in
academia, few of the Haskell books that currently exist focus on the
problems and techniques of everyday programming that we're interested
in.</p>
<p>With this book, we want to show you how to use functional programming
and Haskell to solve realistic problems. This is a hands-on book: every
chapter contains dozens of code samples, and many contain complete
applications. Here are a few examples of the libraries, techniques and
tools that we'll show you how to develop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an application that downloads podcast episodes from the
Internet, and stores its history in an SQL database.</li>
<li>Test your code in an intuitive and powerful way. Describe properties
that ought to be true, then let the QuickCheck library generate test
cases automatically.</li>
<li>Take a grainy phone camera snapshot of a barcode, and turn it into
an identifier that you can use to query a library or bookseller's web
site.</li>
<li>Write code that thrives on the web. Exchange data with servers and
clients written in other languages using JSON notation. Develop a
concurrent link checker.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="a-little-bit-about-you"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> A little bit about you</h2>
<p>What will you need to know before reading this book? We expect that
you already know how to program, but if you've never used a functional
language, that's fine.</p>
<p>No matter what your level of experience is, we have tried to
anticipate your needs: we go out of our way to explain new and
potentially tricky ideas in depth, usually with examples and images to
drive our points home.</p>
<p>As a new Haskell programmer, you'll inevitably start out writing
quite a bit of code by hand for which you could have used a library
function or programming technique, had you just known of its existence.
We've packed this book with information to help you to come up to speed
as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, there will always be a few bumps along the road. If you
start out anticipating an occasional surprise or difficulty along with
the fun stuff, you will have the best experience. Any rough patches you
might hit won't last long.</p>
<p>As you become a more seasoned Haskell programmer, the way that you
write code will change. Indeed, over the course of this book, the way
that we present code will evolve, as we move from the basics of the
language to increasingly powerful and productive features and
techniques.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="what-to-expect-from-haskell"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> What to expect from Haskell</h1>
<p>Haskell is a general purpose programming language. It was designed
without any application niche in mind. Although it takes a strong stand
on how programs should be written, it does not favour one problem domain
over others.</p>
<p>While at its core, the language encourages a pure, lazy style of
functional programming, this is the <em>default</em>, not the only
option. Haskell also supports the more traditional models of procedural
code and strict evaluation. Additionally, although the focus of the
language is squarely on writing statically typed programs, it is
possible (though rarely seen) to write Haskell code in a dynamically
typed manner.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1"
id="compared-to-traditional-static-languages"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Compared to traditional static
languages</h2>
<p>Languages that use simple static type systems have been the mainstay
of the programming world for decades. Haskell is statically typed, but
its notion of what types are for, and what we can do with them, is much
more flexible and powerful than traditional languages. Types make a
major contribution to the brevity, clarity, and efficiency of Haskell
programs.</p>
<p>Although powerful, Haskell's type system is often also unobtrusive.
If we omit explicit type information, a Haskell compiler will
automatically infer the type of an expression or function. Compared to
traditional static languages, to which we must spoon-feed large amounts
of type information, the combination of power and inference in Haskell's
type system significantly reduces the clutter and redundancy of our
code.</p>
<p>Several of Haskell's other features combine to further increase the
amount of work we can fit into a screenful of text. This brings
improvements in development time and agility: we can create reliable
code quickly, and easily refactor it in response to changing
requirements.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Haskell programs may run more slowly than similar programs
written in C or C++. For most of the code we write, Haskell's large
advantages in productivity and reliability outweigh any small
performance disadvantage.</p>
<p>Multicore processors are now ubiquitous, but they remain notoriously
difficult to program using traditional techniques. Haskell provides
unique technologies to make multicore programming more tractable. It
supports parallel programming, software transactional memory for
reliable concurrency, and scales to hundreds of thousands of concurrent
threads.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="compared-to-modern-dynamic-languages"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Compared to modern dynamic
languages</h2>
<p>Over the past decade, dynamically typed, interpreted languages have
become increasingly popular. They offer substantial benefits in
developer productivity. Although this often comes at the cost of a huge
performance hit, for many programming tasks productivity trumps
performance, or performance isn't a significant factor in any case.</p>
<p>Brevity is one area in which Haskell and dynamically typed languages
perform similarly: in each case, we write much less code to solve a
problem than in a traditional language. Programs are often around the
same size in dynamically typed languages and Haskell.</p>
<p>When we consider runtime performance, Haskell almost always has a
huge advantage. Code compiled by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) is
typically between 20 and 60 times faster than code run through a dynamic
language's interpreter. GHC also provides an interpreter, so you can run
scripts without compiling them.</p>
<p>Another big difference between dynamically typed languages and
Haskell lies in their philosophies around types. A major reason for the
popularity of dynamically typed languages is that only rarely do we need
to explicitly mention types. Through automatic type inference, Haskell
offers the same advantage.</p>
<p>Beyond this surface similarity, the differences run deep. In a
dynamically typed language, we can create constructs that are difficult
to express in a statically typed language. However, the same is true in
reverse: with a type system as powerful as Haskell's, we can structure a
program in a way that would be unmanageable or infeasible in a
dynamically typed language.</p>
<p>It's important to recognise that each of these approaches involves
tradeoffs. Very briefly put, the Haskell perspective emphasises safety,
while the dynamically typed outlook favours flexibility. If someone had
already discovered one way of thinking about types that was always best,
we imagine that everyone would know about it by now.</p>
<p>Of course, we have our own opinions about which tradeoffs are more
beneficial. Two of us have years of experience programming in
dynamically typed languages. We love working with them; we still use
them every day; but usually, we prefer Haskell.</p>

<p>For practical work, almost as important as a language itself is the
ecosystem of libraries and tools around it. Haskell has a strong showing
in this area.</p>

systems and CPU architectures</li>
<li>Easy deployment of compiled binaries, unencumbered by licensing
restrictions</li>
<li>Code coverage analysis</li>
<li>Detailed profiling of performance and memory usage</li>
<li>Thorough documentation</li>
<li>Massively scalable support for concurrent and multicore
programming</li>

<p>The GHC compiler ships with a collection of useful libraries. Here
are a few of the common programming needs that these libraries
address.</p>
<ul>
<li>File I/O, and filesystem traversal and manipulation</li>

include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interfaces to all major open source and commercial databases</li>
<li>XML, HTML, and XQuery processing</li>

<h1 data-number="4" id="a-brief-sketch-of-haskells-history"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> A brief sketch of Haskell's
history</h1>
<p>The development of Haskell is rooted in mathematics and computer
science research.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="prehistory"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Prehistory</h2>
<p>A few decades before modern computers were invented, the
mathematician Alonzo Church developed a language called the lambda
calculus. He intended it as a tool for investigating the foundations of
mathematics. The first person to realize the practical connection
between programming and the lambda calculus was John McCarthy, who
created Lisp in 1958.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, computer scientists began to recognise and study
the importance of the lambda calculus. Peter Landin and Christopher
Strachey developed ideas about the foundations of programming languages:
how to reason about what they do (operational semantics) and how to
understand what they mean (denotational semantics).</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, Robin Milner created a more rigorous functional
programming language named ML. While ML was developed to help with
automated proofs of mathematical theorems, it gained a following for
more general computing tasks.</p>
<p>The 1970s saw the emergence of lazy evaluation as a novel strategy.
David Turner developed SASL and KRC, while Rod Burstall and John
Darlington developed NPL and Hope. NPL, KRC and ML influenced the
development of several more languages in the 1980s, including Lazy ML,
Clean, and Miranda.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="early-antiquity"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Early antiquity</h2>
<p>By the late 1980s, the efforts of researchers working on lazy
functional languages were scattered across more than a dozen languages.
Concerned by this diffusion of effort, a number of researchers decided
to form a committee to design a common language. After three years of
work, the committee published the Haskell 1.0 specification in 1990. It
named the language after Haskell Curry, an influential logician.</p>
<p>Many people are rightfully suspicious of "design by committee", but
the work of the Haskell committee is a beautiful example of the best
work a committee can do. They produced an elegant, considered language
design, and succeeded in unifying the fractured efforts of their
research community. Of the thicket of lazy functional languages that
existed in 1990, only Haskell is still actively used.</p>
<p>Since its publication in 1990, the Haskell language standard has seen
several revisions, most recently in 2010. A number of Haskell
implementations have been written, and several are still actively
developed.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, Haskell served two main purposes. On one side, it
gave language researchers a stable language in which to experiment with
making lazy functional programs run efficiently. Other researchers
explored how to construct programs using lazy functional techniques.
Still others used it as a teaching language.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="the-modern-era"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The modern era</h2>
<p>While these basic explorations of the 1990s proceeded, Haskell
remained firmly an academic affair. The informal slogan of those inside
the community was to "avoid success at all costs". Few outsiders had
heard of the language at all. Indeed, functional programming as a field
was quite obscure.</p>
<p>During this time, the mainstream programming world experimented with
relatively small tweaks: from programming in C, to C++, to Java.
Meanwhile, on the fringes, programmers were beginning to tinker with
new, more dynamic languages. Guido van Rossum designed Python; Larry
Wall created Perl; and Yukihiro Matsumoto developed Ruby.</p>
<p>As these newer languages began to seep into wider use, they spread
some crucial ideas. The first was that programmers are not merely
capable of working in expressive languages; in fact, they flourish. The
second was in part a byproduct of the rapid growth in raw computing
power of that era: it's often smart to sacrifice some execution
performance in exchange for a big increase in programmer productivity.
Finally, several of these languages borrowed from functional
programming.</p>
<p>Over the past half a decade, Haskell has successfully escaped from
academia, buoyed in part by the visibility of Python, Ruby, and even
Javascript. The language now has a vibrant and fast-growing culture of
open source and commercial users, and researchers continue to use it to
push the boundaries of performance and expressiveness.</p>

<p>This book would not exist without the Haskell community: an anarchic,
hopeful cabal of artists, theoreticians and engineers, who for twenty
years have worked to create a better, bug-free programming world. The
people of the Haskell community are unique in their combination of
friendliness and intellectual depth.</p>
<p>We wish to thank our editor, Mike Loukides, and the production team
at O'Reilly for all of their advice and assistance.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.1" id="bryan"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Bryan</h2>
<p>I had a great deal of fun working with John and Don. Their
independence, good nature, and formidable talent made the writing
process remarkably smooth.</p>
<p>Simon Peyton Jones took a chance on a college student who emailed him
out of the blue in early 1994. Interning for him over that summer
remains a highlight of my professional life. With his generosity,
boundless energy, and drive to collaborate, he inspires the whole
Haskell community.</p>
<p>My children, Cian and Ruairi, always stood ready to help me to unwind
with wonderful, madcap little-boy games.</p>
<p>Finally, of course, I owe a great debt to my wife, Shannon, for her
love, wisdom, and support during the long gestation of this book.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.2" id="john"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> John</h2>
<p>I am so glad to be able to work with Bryan and Don on this project.
The depth of their Haskell knowledge and experience is amazing. I
enjoyed finally being able to have the three of us sit down in the same
room – over a year after we started writing.</p>
<p>My 2-year-old Jacob, who decided that it would be fun to use a
keyboard too, and is always eager to have me take a break from the
computer and help him make some fun typing noises on a 50-year-old
Underwood typewriter.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I wouldn't have ever been involved in this project
without the love, support, and encouragement from my wife, Terah.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.3" id="don"><span
class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Don</h2>
<p>Before all else, I'd like to thank my amazing co-conspirators, John
and Bryan, for encouragment, advice and motivation.</p>
<p>My colleagues at Galois, Inc., who daily wield Haskell in the real
world, provided regular feedback and war stories, and helped ensured a
steady supply of espresso.</p>
<p>My PhD supervisor, Manuel Chakravarty, and the PLS research group,
who provided encouragement, vision and energy, and showed me that a
rigorous, foundational approach to programming can make the impossible
happen.</p>
<p>And, finally, thanks to Suzie, for her insight, patience and
love.</p>
